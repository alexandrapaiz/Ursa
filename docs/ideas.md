# The Ledger — Ursa

Contract in docs/standards/pm.md §4.

### 2026-09-18 — Repo split: Major and Minor
- Trigger: owner at bootstrap: combine now, "then we'll split it in two different ones"
- What: criteria and mechanics for splitting ursa-major and ursa-minor into their own repos with history preserved
- First step: PM seat proposes split criteria in its first activated run
- Cost: $0
- Status: proposed

### 2026-09-18 — The taste pipeline (sessions → whys → portable taste)
- Trigger: owner directive at the engineering session: regular chats and
  code sessions must become useful for RLHF; the H is the human building,
  the RLAIF reverse-engineers the whys; stored taste for the user first,
  anonymized signal for labs later
- What: interpretation layer over outcome records — a local model pass
  distills evidence-backed taste axioms into a user-owned taste.json,
  exported as a portable context block; design at
  docs/design/taste-pipeline.md, MVP in ursa-major/src/taste/
- First step: shipped as MVP on branch taste/mvp (distill, merge with
  revocation tombstones and tension wiring, export, 10 tests)
- Cost: $0 (runs on the owner's local claude CLI)
- Status: accepted (owner-directed 2026-09-18)

### 2026-09-19 — Agentic-forward: Ursa as the agents' HQ
- Trigger: owner product idea, verbatim: "being agentic forward.
  helping this guide agents as well, almost like an hq"
- What: agents become first-class taste consumers and producers. A
  brief→work→debrief loop on the existing MCP server: get_briefing
  (domain, files) returns relevant rules, nearest cases via the
  client-side embedding retrieval, and learned guardrails before an
  agent starts; the PR reader grades the run into a record after. The
  owner's own seat-org practice (charters, incidents, learning logs)
  productized for any agent fleet. HQ serves evidence, never orders —
  prices and cases, per the principles; the agent remains the judge of
  application.
- First step: add get_briefing to the M2 MCP server surface
  (plan §15 stub); dogfood on Ursa's own seats
- Cost: $0
- Status: accepted (owner-directed 2026-09-19)
