# The Ledger — Ursa

Contract in docs/standards/pm.md §4.

### 2026-09-18 — Repo split: Major and Minor
- Trigger: owner at bootstrap: combine now, "then we'll split it in two different ones"
- What: criteria and mechanics for splitting ursa-major and ursa-minor into their own repos with history preserved
- First step: PM seat proposes split criteria in its first activated run
- Cost: $0
- Status: proposed

### 2026-09-18 — The tuning pipeline (sessions → whys → portable tuning)
- Trigger: owner directive at the engineering session: regular chats and
  code sessions must become useful for RLHF; the H is the human building,
  the RLAIF reverse-engineers the whys; stored tuning for the user first,
  anonymized signal for labs later
- What: interpretation layer over outcome records — a local model pass
  distills evidence-backed tuning axioms into a user-owned tuning.json,
  exported as a portable context block; design at
  docs/design/tuning-pipeline.md, MVP in ursa-major/src/tuning/
- First step: shipped as MVP on branch tuning/mvp (distill, merge with
  revocation tombstones and tension wiring, export, 10 tests)
- Cost: $0 (runs on the owner's local claude CLI)
- Status: accepted (owner-directed 2026-09-18)

### 2026-09-19 — Agentic-forward: Ursa as the agents' HQ
- Trigger: owner product idea, verbatim: "being agentic forward.
  helping this guide agents as well, almost like an hq"
- What: agents become first-class tuning consumers and producers. A
  brief→work→debrief loop on the existing MCP server: get_briefing
  (domain, files) returns relevant rules, nearest cases via the
  client-side embedding retrieval, and learned guardrails before an
  agent starts; the PR reader grades the run into a record after. The
  owner's own seat-org practice (charters, incidents, learning logs)
  productized for any agent fleet. HQ serves evidence, never orders —
  prices and cases, per the principles; the agent remains the judge of
  application.
- First step: add get_briefing to the M2 MCP server surface
  (plan §15 stub); dogfood on Ursa's own seats
- Cost: $0
- Status: accepted (owner-directed 2026-09-19)

### 2026-09-19 — Tuning packs (the omarchy lesson)
- Trigger: owner asked "thoughts on omarchy for our product?" — omarchy
  proves developers adopt curated tuning-as-artifact wholesale
- What: exportable, adoptable tuning profiles — a respected builder's
  distilled tuning.md installable the way people adopt omarchy configs;
  Ursa generalizes omakase (one chef's tuning) into your own learned
  palate, and lets either be shared deliberately. Consumer-side
  network effect no competitor has. Requires the redaction/consent
  standard before any pack leaves a machine
- First step: an `ursa tuning export --pack` variant that strips
  evidence quotes and ships rules + case specs only, owner-reviewed
- Cost: $0
- Status: proposed

### 2026-09-20 — Finished work is not only chat: hosted and visual outputs
- Trigger: owner directive: Ursa must analyze not just chats. Sometimes
  the final output is hosted on GitHub, or it is visual. That is
  captured in code, but she wants it stated explicitly.
- What: the finished artifact the record joins against can live in
  three places, and the capture path should name which. (1) The chat
  trace. (2) A hosted artifact: a repo on GitHub, a deployed site, a
  published page; git commit pairs already cover the repo case and a
  deployed URL is the retention evidence for the site case. (3) A
  visual artifact: a rendered UI, a design, a page the user looked at
  and accepted or corrected by eye. The n=1 trial was exactly this, the
  Ursa Minor site, and its loops were visual ("looks like crashing",
  "still too dark"). The code carries the visual outcome, but the
  correction happened on the render, so the record should carry the
  rendered state alongside the source when one exists (a screenshot
  per accepted commit, or the deployed URL at that commit).
- First step: add `artifact.kind: 'chat' | 'repo' | 'hosted' | 'visual'`
  and an optional `artifact.renderRef` (deployed URL or screenshot
  path) to the record schema, and have `ursa run` fill `repo` and, when
  a deploy is detectable, `hosted`.
- Cost: $0
- Status: accepted (owner-directed 2026-09-20)

### 2026-09-20 — Finding: merge commits are not edits; the PR reader is load-bearing
- Trigger: the M1 redo on alexandria. With merge commits excluded as
  pairing targets, the repo yields ONE real generated-then-edited pair
  (the W37 digest, 2026-09-08). Yesterday's 19 records were 18 merge
  artifacts plus that one; a 95-record run before the fix was 69 pairs
  against a single PR merge.
- What: in a repo run by agent seats through pull requests, the owner
  almost never edits an agent commit directly on main. Her corrections
  live in two other places: inside the PR (review comments, follow-up
  commits on the branch before merge) and in chat. So the commit-pair
  path is thin for agent-run repos, and the PR reader (plan §8) plus
  the session trace are where the signal actually is. The pair finder
  now skips merge commits (test added, 26 passing).
- First step: promote the PR reader from the GitHub-spine milestone
  into M1 scope for the alexandria trial; read each merged PR's review
  comments and branch commits as the correction stream.
- Cost: $0
- Status: proposed

### 2026-09-23 — Upstream: Linear board-of-record practice to HQ
- Trigger: ADR-005; the owner runs Linear across the portfolio (teams
  already exist for epitome, Alexandria, Atelier, Alexandra Systems)
- What: propose the §1f Linear mechanics as a company standard at HQ,
  replacing or amending ADR-008's GitHub-Projects default
- First step: PM carries this to HQ as a ledger note per §1c
- Cost: $0
- Status: proposed
