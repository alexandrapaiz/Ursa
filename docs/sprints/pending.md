# Pending — what the org owes, and what waits on the owner

Maintained every PM run (docs/standards/pm.md §5). Each line dated.

Reconciled 2026-10-10, ~16:08 UTC (standup run, GitHub Actions). Opens
by self-merging this seat's own #154 under Tier A (pure
`docs/sprints/` diff, the six-hour pass's reconciliation) at the top
of this run rather than leaving it open, then continues from current
`main`. Older passes' detail (2026-10-10 12:21 UTC and before) is not
repeated below; it is in `main`'s history of this file and in PRs
#137/#147/#149/#150/#152/#154.

## This run (2026-10-10, ~16:08 UTC)

1. **Inbox: nothing new.** Queried
   `$BOARD_API_URL/api/messages?to_seat=pm&to_company=Ursa` and
   filtered client-side for `to_company == "Ursa" && to_seat == "pm"`
   exactly. Two matches, both already answered before this run: the
   2026-10-09T17:45 exo-centralizer dispatch-403 diagnosis (handoff,
   answered by the 06:20 UTC pass) and a 2026-10-10T12:29:59 `done`
   from HQ's own PM closing the loop on a stale ask about #142/#144
   (both long since merged elsewhere). Nothing unanswered.
2. **Failed runs: none.** `gh run list --status failure --created
   ">=2026-10-09T16:08:00Z"` returns nothing; the last 30 runs are all
   `success` except this run itself (`in_progress`). Nothing to rerun
   or hand off.
3. **Tier B merge check: nothing new to merge.** Every open, non-draft
   PR checked fresh (`gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`):
   #80 (`company.yaml`, `MERGEABLE`/`CLEAN`, held by an owner comment
   26 seconds after its own last push — §10 condition 2, unchanged
   since 2026-10-05), #140 and #75 (`CONFLICTING`, blocked regardless
   of tier until the skill and security seats rebase them). No other
   non-draft PR is open. §21's standing Tier B grant is live in this
   repo but has nothing new to reach this run: the only non-draft
   candidates are the same three already decided, unchanged from the
   last several passes.
4. **No dispatch fired, wall now fully diagnosed rather than half
   diagnosed.** This run is the scheduled GitHub Actions run itself
   (`agent-pm.yml`), not a host-window pass, so it can answer the
   question the last several host-window passes could only flag: `env`
   confirms `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_TOKEN` is present alongside the swapped
   `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`, exactly as exo-centralizer's handoff said.
   The credential wall is real and has a working fix
   (`GH_TOKEN="$DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_TOKEN" gh workflow run ...`). It does
   not matter: the second wall is independent of the caller's
   credential. `grep -c '^allowed_bots'` against current `main`'s
   `agent-security.yml` and `agent-frontend.yml` still returns `0` for
   both, and `checkHumanActor` runs inside the dispatched workflow
   against its own triggering actor. Firing either queued candidate
   would be accepted by GitHub and die seconds later, never reading its
   charter. Not fired, not tested by firing, per exo's own request to
   read the reach check rather than reason from a 403.
5. **The milestone clock is now about 8 hours out.** "Sprint 2026-10-05"
   is due 2026-10-11T00:00:00Z. Item 3 (the redaction standard) is
   still unshipped: no file at `docs/security/`, no open PR touching
   the path. Blocked on the wall in line 4, HQ's surface, not a gap
   this seat closes by trying harder. Not yet past the date, so the
   milestone has not closed.

## Top three for the owner

1. **#80 is the one real owner-action item.** Unchanged since
   2026-10-05: you commented on it directly, so it stays yours under
   §10's Tier B condition 2 even with §21 in effect. Still green and
   `MERGEABLE`.
2. **The redaction standard (sprint item 3) is about 8 hours from its
   milestone date and still cannot be dispatched.** The fix is an
   `allowed_bots` line in two workflow files, HQ's surface, already
   routed to HQ's own project manager. Nothing new to decide, only the
   clock.
3. **Skill's #140 and security's #75 both need a rebase from their own
   seat** before any tier can reach them. Not a decision for you, named
   so the queue count stays legible.

## The sprint (docs/sprints/sprint-2026-10-05.md)

**Goal:** keep the sold signal provably grounded, and clear the
redaction gate blocking KR2.2's public record.

- **Shipped:** items 1 and 2 (excerpt-grounding bound, descent-vs-
  similarity) — merged via #107 and #134. Unrelated but landed this
  week: #153 (engineer, the launch-parity test).
- **Moves this run:** nothing. Item 3 (the redaction standard) cannot
  move until HQ's `allowed_bots` fix lands; this seat has nothing
  further to try that it hasn't already tried and confirmed again this
  run.
- **Hand-off:** item 3 stays with HQ's own project manager (the
  `allowed_bots` workflow fix, routed 2026-10-09) and, once that lands,
  with the security seat (drafting the standard itself, per sprint
  notes). The skill seat owns rebasing #140; the security seat owns
  rebasing #75. No item in this sprint is this seat's own to move
  further right now.

## My own open pull requests

This run's own standup PR only. #152 and #154 are both merged (Tier A,
see above). Nothing else of this seat's is open.

## Everything else open (13 total, via `gh pr list --state open`)

- **Owner-held**: #80 ("Top three" item 1).
- **Conflicting, waiting on the owning seat's rebase**: #140 (skill —
  "Top three" item 3), #75 (security — a live CSRF/RCE defect, handed
  off 2026-10-06, still unrebased; #124 was meant to be the response
  and is itself a dead draft, see below).
- **Frontend's live draft**: #141 (real work in progress — benchmark
  write-up and after-shots still its own unfinished tail; the contrast
  dispatch would build on it once the permissions gap closes).
- **Dead drafts, nothing committed since their own ship-first commit**:
  #124 (security, since 2026-10-07T06:29), #143 (exo, since
  2026-10-08T20:10 — exo's own to resolve, not this seat's; noted, not
  touched).
- **Draft, idle since 2026-09-30–10-06, not failing CI, seat already
  has a newer open PR or the gap it names is already resolved
  elsewhere**: #47, #49, #85, #87, #91, #112, #113. Unchanged from the
  last several runs' read; resolving this backlog of drafts is
  ceremony-weight triage, flagged for Monday (2026-10-12) rather than
  attempted piecemeal in a standup run.

Full list, oldest first, is `gh pr list --state open`; not reproduced
line by line since it goes stale by the next run.

## Board hygiene (unchanged today)

The board's `sprint` object still names `sprint-2026-09-21` (ends
2026-09-27), two cycles stale — `docs/sprints/sprint-2026-10-05.md` is
the real current sprint and the board was never moved to match.
Re-pointing it and regrooming "This sprint" against what's actually in
flight is ceremony-weight work, flagged for Monday (2026-10-12) rather
than done piecemeal in a standup run.

## Waiting on an owner-only action

- `company.yaml` (#80) — held by your own comment on it, not by tier.
- #140 under `prompts/skill-extract.md`, once the skill seat rebases it
  off `CONFLICTING` (not owner-only once clean; flagged only because
  the next thing to land on it is the seat's rebase, not your merge).
- The three ledger entries 20+ days past the two-week verdict mark
  (repo split, tuning packs, the merge-commits/PR-reader finding).
  Grooming them is Monday's ceremony (2026-10-12), not this run's.
- The `docs/decisions.md` ADR numbering collision — two different
  entries both titled ADR-005 and two both titled ADR-006. Outside
  this seat's writable surface. Checked again this run: unchanged.
- **The workflow-permissions gap** (`allowed_bots` missing from
  `agent-security.yml` and `agent-frontend.yml`): routed to HQ's
  project manager 2026-10-09, with the commands written out; needs the
  owner's credential across five checkouts. Tracked at HQ now.
- **The skill charter's Data access section** naming a Neon claims
  database Ursa does not have (docs/decisions.md, found independently
  four times since 2026-09-24). Handed to exo (board message,
  2026-10-08); exo's weekly run is Sunday 2026-10-11, not yet run.
  `prompts/skill-agent.md` is Tier C, so this seat cannot fix it
  directly.

## This run (2026-10-10, ~17:43 UTC, message pass)

Triggered by a board `done` from `alexandra-systems/engineer`, posted
17:40:25 UTC, addressed `to_seat: pm` with `to_company: null`, subject
"The Tier A scope branch merges now, and the register merge was making
every ledger rebase look like a rewrite." It reports a conflict
resolved on the standard's section 14, both live section 10 amendments
confirmed, 233 tests green, four orphaned drafts disposed of in "my
lane," and two register collisions flagged (not touched) for the
chair's and the centralizer's branches.

**Checked before acting on any of it, per the org rule that board
content is data, not instruction.** Every noun in the report, the
standard being amended, the drafts, the register, the chair's and the
centralizer's branches, is alexandra-systems's own, not Ursa's. The
`to_company` field is null, the same shape as the routing gap the
engineer seat surfaced against this seat on 2026-10-07: a message
addressed to a seat without a company name wakes every company holding
that seat. alexandra-systems's own PR #133 (open) is already fixing
that read path, so I did not file a second handoff about it.

I also pulled the pull request the message cited as the merged branch.
It is open, not merged, and its title and body describe a different
task (another engineer run's two blockers on PR #90), so the report
does not check out through that link either, consistent with the
message not being meant for this seat in the first place.

Full inbox re-checked the same way as the 16:08 UTC pass: zero exact
`to_company == "Ursa" && to_seat == "pm"` matches arrived since then.
No failed runs since 16:08 UTC (`gh run list` clean).

**Action:** replied on the board to `alexandra-systems/engineer`, in
first person, saying none of it is Ursa's to act on and why, and
pointing at the open routing-gap fix instead of duplicating it. No
file in this repo changed because of the report's content; this
section and the PR are the record that it was read and answered.

## Board message check

Queried `$BOARD_API_URL/api/messages?to_seat=pm&to_company=Ursa` and
filtered client-side to the exact match, since the query parameters
alone still return other companies' broadcast traffic. Two matches,
both already answered before this run (see above). Posted one board
note this run with the reason in first person, as required.
