# The skill-extract format (Ursa)

Written 2026-09-24 by the skill agent, first Ursa run, under
`prompts/skill-agent.md` step 2. The charter points at a gold specimen
(`skills/harness-engineering/SKILL.md`) that exists in alexandria and
not here, and it points at a claims database that Ursa does not have.
This file is what replaces both until those exist. It is a proposal to
the owner, not a settled standard, and it should be revised by whoever
finds it wrong in use.

## 1. What a skill is, in Ursa

A skill is a procedure plus the judgment needed to run it, written so
that a competent agent or person who loads it can do the work without
the author present. Two properties separate an Ursa skill from a
prompt someone liked:

1. **Every load-bearing sentence cites its evidence.** A reader can
   follow the citation to a line of code, a paragraph of a published
   document, or a claim id, and check the sentence against it.
2. **Judgment that no evidence backs is labelled as ours.** The reader
   must always be able to tell what the evidence says from what we
   think. Overstating evidence is the one sin the provenance reviewer
   exists to catch, per the charter's Boundaries.

A skill that cites nothing is a prompt. A skill whose citations do not
check out is worse than a prompt, because it borrows credibility it
has not earned.

## 2. Layout

```
skills/<slug>/
  SKILL.md         the skill itself, frontmatter plus body
  TRIGGER-TEST.md  the activation test, five prompts, reasoning per prompt
```

One directory per skill. The slug is kebab-case and names the work the
skill does, not the topic it is about. `adjudicating-uncertain-spans`
is a slug. `outcome-records` is a topic.

## 3. Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: adjudicating-uncertain-spans
description: >
  Use when adjudicating spans a provenance resolver flagged uncertain...
version: 0.1.0
status: draft            # draft | reviewed | validated | superseded
validated: false         # true only after the ADR-13 panel, or the owner, has passed it
owner_seat: skill
created: 2026-09-24
revised: 2026-09-24
evidence_scheme: repo    # repo | claim
evidence:
  - ref: E1
    what: the four span classes and their definitions
    source: ursa-major/src/types.ts:5-14
  - ref: E2
    what: the two match thresholds and the combined score
    source: ursa-major/src/match.ts:4-8,51-53
supersedes: []
---
```

Every field is required except `supersedes`. Three of them carry the
weight:

**`evidence`** is the receipt table. Each entry gets a short `ref`, a
one-line `what`, and a `source`. The body cites refs and never inlines
a path, so that when a source moves, one table entry changes instead of
twenty sentences.

**`evidence_scheme`** says what kind of receipt the `source` fields
hold. `claim` means claim ids out of a claims database, which is the
alexandria form the charter assumes. `repo` means paths with line
anchors into this repository, which is the only form available in Ursa
today and the reason this field exists at all. A skill may not mix the
two schemes silently. If it draws on both, it declares `claim` and
writes repo sources as full paths so the difference is visible.

**`validated`** is false until a judge that is not the author has
passed the skill. The judge of record is the ADR-13 provenance,
adversary and validator panel once it runs in Ursa. It does not run
here yet, so until it does, the owner's merge is the only gate, and a
merge alone does not flip `validated`. Say so in the PR every time.

## 4. Body

Four sections, in this order.

1. **When this fires.** The activation conditions, concrete enough to
   test. Name the artifacts and the situations, not the subject area.
2. **The procedure.** Numbered steps a reader can execute. Each step
   says what to do, what evidence backs it, and what the step outputs.
3. **Judgment.** The calls the procedure cannot make for you, with the
   reasoning that decides them. This is where most of a skill's value
   sits, and it is the part a checklist cannot carry.
4. **Limits.** What the skill does not cover and where its evidence
   runs out. A skill with no limits section has not been thought about
   hard enough.

Citation form is a trailing `[E3]` or `[E3, E7]` on the sentence the
evidence backs. Judgment with no evidence behind it is prefixed
**Ours:** and carries no ref. Both forms must appear in any honest
skill, because a procedure with no judgment is a script and a skill
with no citations is a prompt.

## 5. The trigger test

Market evidence in alexandria's corpus says most public skills never
fire. That number is not re-citable here, because Ursa has no access to
the claim behind it, so treat it as motivation rather than as a
finding. The requirement it produced stands on its own reasoning: a
skill that never activates delivers nothing no matter how good its
body is.

Every skill ships a `TRIGGER-TEST.md` with five prompts. Three are
realistic prompts that should activate the skill. Two are near misses
that should not, and near miss means genuinely close, sharing the
skill's vocabulary while falling outside its work. Each of the five
carries one or two sentences of reasoning for why it lands the way it
does. The test is written against the `description` field, and when
the test fails, the description is what changes.

Ours: the near misses are the load-bearing half. Three prompts that
obviously fire prove nothing about a description, since a description
naming its own topic will always match its own topic. The pair that
must not fire is what shows the description has an edge.

## 6. Rendering

Whatever a skill cites has to be readable by someone who did not write
it. Ursa has no skills library surface today. The `ursa-minor/` site
has `app`, `components`, `lib` and `public`, and no skills route, so
nothing here renders anywhere yet. The skill agent does not build that
surface, per its Boundaries. It records the gap in `docs/ideas.md` and
leaves the build to the engineer or frontend seat.

The constraint a future surface has to meet is set by the evidence
table: a reader must be able to click a `ref` in the body and land on
the cited source. That is the same auditability property the outcome
record promises its buyers, applied to our own product.

## 7. Revision

A skill revises when its evidence changes, and that is the
differentiator, so it has to actually happen. Concretely: when a cited
source moves, changes meaning, or is retracted, the skill's `revised`
date changes, the affected sentences change with it, and `version`
increments. A skill whose evidence has moved under it and whose text
has not is a broken promise rather than a stale file.
